        <div id="croissant"><p><b>Croissant One</b><br>
            Croissant is a typeface inspired by the Parisian spirit, in the people and <br>
            the landscapes there. The lowercase letters have smooth round shapes, <br>
            and a nice long out-stroke to connect nearly every glyph, reminding the reader <br>
            of elegant French handwriting. The uppercases have a classical structure and <br>
            soft terminals that embody the spirit of this multi-purpose typeface.</p></div>

        <div id="pixelify"><p><b>Pixelify Sans</b><br>
            Pixelify Sans fonts are a unique style of typography that originated <br>
            in the 1980s with the rise of computer graphics and video games. <br>
            Pixel fonts are characterized by their blocky, pixelated appearance, <br>
            which is achieved by using a grid of small, square pixels to create each <br>
            letterform.</p></div>
